# OWASP Security Review Plugin

A Claude Code plugin for security review and implementation support based on OWASP Cheat Sheet Series.

## Features

- Security code review based on OWASP guidelines
- Vulnerability detection and remediation guidance
- Coverage of common security topics: XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, authentication, authorization, and more

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install owasp-security-review@ayuzaka/agent-plugins
```

## Usage

### Commands

#### `/security-review-frontend`

Review frontend code for security vulnerabilities:

```
/security-review-frontend src/components/LoginForm.tsx
```

### Skills

#### `owasp-security-review`

General security review skill that leverages OWASP Cheat Sheet Series:

```
/skill owasp-security-review Review the authentication module
```

## Setup

The skill uses OWASP Cheat Sheet Series as a reference. To set up the cheatsheets locally:

```bash
bash skills/owasp-security-review/scripts/setup_cheatsheets.sh
```

This clones the cheatsheets to `~/.local/share/owasp-cheatsheets` by default.
